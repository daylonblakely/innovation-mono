## About

This project is intended to practice and demonstrate code sharing between apps and developing in a containerized monorepo. The repo contains two apps, `todo-client` and `todo-api`. These separate applications can be thought of as containers for code that has been added to the `libs` folder.

## Start the app(s)

### todo-client

To start the development server run `npx nx serve todo-client`. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:4200/

### todo-api

To start the development server run `npx nx serve todo-api`. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000/

### running in docker (recommended)

The recommended way to run todo-client and todo-api for development is by using docker compose. The `docker-compose.yml` at the root of the repo will start the client, api, and a `mongodb` database in separate containers. The database can also be connected to by using Compass (see the docker compose service for connection string). Since this is an integrated monorepo, the versions of each npm package are constistant in each app. This allows the docker containers to use a shared volume for `node_modules`. To run in docker, run the `docker compose up` command.
